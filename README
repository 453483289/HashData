HashData created by Sam Brown (sam@datacurse.org) licensed under the MIT license.

A command line Hash/Encryption/Encoding function detector, After seeing lots of people in the past struggling to identify various hashes and encodings etc I decided to make a simple tool to do it for them. The listings aren't complete and will generally give numerous possibilities for each input due to the nature of a lot of functions having output in a similar format. All the regexs used are provided in a seperate text file foranyone whoever needs them for anything.
